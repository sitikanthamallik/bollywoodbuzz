<h1>Who Is Asin Thottumkal's New Friend?</h1>
<p>Asin Thottumkal, who hasn't been seen on-screen since her last film Khiladi 786 has reportedly found friendship in Micromax founder and executive director Rahul Sharma. Not too long ago, Asin Thottumkal had rubbished rumours of her dating someone in the US, and now the actress has been spotted with Rahul Sharma, founder and executive director of Micromax on several occasions. The two met nearly 10-months ago through a common friend</p>

<p>Rahul was seen at Asin's birthday party on October 26th last year. The two have been noticed together many times after that as well. Rahul had recently told media-persons that he considers only his parents and sisters as family, and since his sisters are now married, it's only his parents and him. Well, now...it does seem like Rahul has a nice friend that he can call family! Recently, there were lot of talks about Asin seeing somebody in America. She had then made it clear that she is not seeing anybody and has no marriage plans in near future. She said she wants to focus on her career and did not want to settle down so soon. Now, it remains to be seen whether Asin and Rahul are 'just' friends or 'special'</p>
